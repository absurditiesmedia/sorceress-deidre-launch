Reading my old journals I find it interesting to see how my perspective has changed. I had no effective way to explain the creative process just 5 years ago. The core of the concept was there, but it lacked the detail necessary to do anything but stumble through it without really understanding whether I truly knew what I was doing. No wonder I got so little satisfaction from my attempts to create or consume art. I was questioning every step in the process. Now from a series of experiences I understand that the meaning of art reveals itself as the work is created. I understand now how it's possible to train a person on the process, but my mind would not allow this to happen. I must understand why.

My best attempt to describe this is a force beyond our ability to comprehend - this is where so many people invoke things like "at the quantum level" and there's a reason why that cliche exists. It is the boundary where humanity's understanding of the cosmos begins to fall off. And most people don't understand what that means any more than they understand the differential geometry used to describe it. This is where it becomes possible that the theory does not accurately describe reality. Reality is certainly, orders of magnitude more complicated than this. There's no actual reason to believe that with the next great breakthrough in our understanding of the cosmos physicists will be able to announce that they are "done" that everything to know about the fabric of the universe is known. As far as I know, there's a handful of concepts in the world that we truly understand completely. And the only one I can think of off the top of my head is the relationship between the lengths of sides of a right trangle.

Any assumptions one might make to quantify the completeness of the working model of reality that's been created over entire history of academic and scientific pursuit with, say, a function of n, where n is the number of years humans have been trying to build an understanding of reality and p is a real number between 0 and 1 representing the proportion of reality that is described by theory, by a reasonable extrapolation from historical views among academics, would best be written as: p appraches zero as n approaches infinity. We will never have a complete understanding of everything that exists.

There will always be mysteries. This is the realm of the mystical. Where it becomes clear that atheism is just as dogmatic as creationism. How fantastic our understanding of reality is compared to the universe of the early catholic church, whose mythology even included the existence of a soul or consciousness as separate from the body. Collective experience is such that it's almost undeniable there is something going on, something bigger than our individual selves. In a specific state of relaxed alertness, thoughts emerge from the subconscious in an endless stream of creativity that's impossible to belive originated from the self alone. Instead the artist acts as a medium for a larger consciousness and creates a recording of the ineffable elements of the culture of the time.

Religious people call it God, new-agey people call it "the universe" and I used to think it was all hippie bullshit until something happened to me that I cannot explain and it was like my mind flipped upside down and began to function more effectively. Yet I found myself believing in things I would have earlier dismissed as religious or hippie bullshit. Primarily that I _just knew_ reincarnation is a real thing. I can't explain why, I mean to say, without being able to take whatever happened in my head and make it happen in someone else's because there are no words, don't even believe it could be broken into a process if there were.

I can only say that I never experienced _knowing_ without tangible evidence. And of course I found myself questioning my sanity. Still do to some extent, but along with this _knowledge_ came a lifting of a fog. My reading comprehension increased. I'll find myself reading a Wikipedia entry on a topic that's entirely foreign to me. I no longer have to re-read sections 2-3 times. Only once, sometimes, usually if there's talking or noise distracting me. When I read history, I can sense the feeling of the time period. I don't know if everyone has this, but I've always had a very specific feeling that is associated with, roughly, each decade. But they used to stop at the one just before my birth. I would guess this is because the style and aesthetic of the things that exist in the world are a few years behind.

For instance, an older house with paneling and shag carpet, framed macrame tapestries, lots of yellow, gold, orange, and red color schemes with rounded fonts. Pointed lapels, polyester, and platform shoes are things we commonly associate with the 1970s aesthetic. I was not alive during those years, but a lot of people still wore those clothes, decorated their homes, and printed marketing materials were still in circulation long enough for me to associate with the things of the that time such that they combined to form the type of association I imagine a synesthete might experience, but i don't perceive a specific color.

It's more a distinct feeling, like a distinct emotion. It's not exactly the same thing because it doesn't invoke a strong physiological response like many emotions do, but the quality of the experience makes it impossible to communicate. I might not be able to describe as many elements of the aesthetic associated with a time period so far before my birth where there is no clear photo-graphical record, but now these periods have their own "feelings" which is the best label I can come up with to express this ineffable concept.

I simply need to read about enough of the events of the time - not the art history, architecture, clothing styles or things I might pick up on if I were to read a work of fiction, extensively studied the artists of the time and other means of storing a cultural record, which, in the absence of audio and video media to store an accurate recording of the sensory experience of the world during a specific range in time for later playback (audio/video/photo/modern print process) is an unreliable representation and must be reconstructed from secondary representations such as text and illustration.

A particularly striking example of the incompleteness of the historical record is that no living human has ever heard a completely accurate replication of any musical performance occuring prior to the invention of the wax cylinder. Our record of all of the music created before ~150 years ago is limited to sheet music, which, prior to the 1600s, was crude and lacking in all the elements needed to accurately represent the composer's intention. And for all the symbols and elements available in the sheet music we know today, it is still beholden to the composers subjective interpretation of those elements. Much like our understanding of reality, how do we determine the point at which these recordings of sound waves, and changes in the electronic spectrum are _complete_ is a video truly _complete_ until you can zoom in to view the indivdual particles? Is it complete until video stores the entirety of the electromagnetic spectrum rather than the thin band we map 32-bit color space onto.

I see no reason why in the future pixels wont be represented in 2048, 4096 or more bits, and the creation of sensors responsive to the entire EM spectum will be used in camera technology such that it's possible to store a reprensation of the light acrosss the entire EM spectrum, because while this doesnt describe the sensory experience for humans, there are uses for this information, it exists beyond the ability of _our_ sensory organs to detect, but we regularly make use of this information to send wireless data between anteannas, to destroy the flavor of the food we eat in exchange for the convenience of remaining ignorant to the process of food preparation, and to make images of the insides of things without cutting them apart. From a perspective outside a human centric view of reality, a variety of animals, such as bees have a wider variety of visual sensory neurons giving the ability to perceive portions of the electromagnetic spectrum visually that extend beyond our visual spectrum. For them, there are many colors we will never perceive. We can only shift them down or compress the spectrum to map it onto the wavelengths to which the cones in the center of our retinas are sensitive.

For all we know... we know nothing at all. The relationship between intelligence and perceived informedness has always been an inverse one. With everything we learn, we become aware of at least that much more that we do not. The greatest fallacy of contemporary thought is the idea that because a thing hasn't been measured or observed, it does not exist. I struggle with one element of spirituality that falls under the inverse of this rule, but to say I haven't observed this or anything that might be described as evidence of it would be an overstatement.
